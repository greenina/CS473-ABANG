## Project Summary

- While maintaining close relationships is the most important work we do in our lives and keeping the bond with friends make a big portion in that, maintaining the bond with old friends gets harder as we grow older.
- Our solution is to provide an effective system that supports giving shape to “memories” - which is an abstract concept - by saving and sharing them, and also to lower the burden and complexity of deciding what to do by providing an effective voting system that can easily capture bucket list items
- Our system is unique in the way that it focuses on "getting inspiration from shared bucket lists" rather than "the action of sharing" itself, and in the process of effective decision, we allow each member of the group to express their preferences freely.
